## Additional Resources

A good starting place is the [LitElement documentation](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/), and the [Material Web Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components) have some useful information (since they're also based on LitElement).

## Motivation

The idea for these components didn't just pop out of the blue. I've been developing components and application frameworks for multiple platforms for many years and have been frustrated with the underlying components used to build line of business applications. There's very little in the open source world that caters for business applications and commercial products are, well, commercial. They try to cater for the widest possible audience and continue adding features to justify paid upgrades, which results in bloat and a lot of unnecessary features for any given user. The Open Business Application Platform Web Components try a different approach and provide an opinionated solution that just gets the job done.

Obviously, none of this would be possible with shamelessly studying other excellent products and libraries to figure out how to do things. Special thanks go to:

* [Polymer](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/), which got me started with Web Components
* [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/) is just amazing - that's all.
* [Polymer Elements](https://www.webcomponents.org/author/PolymerElements) - I learn something new from them every day.
* [Material Web Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components) are an excellent LitElement resource.
* [Material Design](https://material.io/design) - I live here.
* [Wired Elements](https://wiredjs.com/) - Another excellent LitElement component suite to study.
* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - not web, but their component suite is second to none and excellent for ideas.
* [Open Web Component Recommendations](https://open-wc.org/) - just use it, no arguments.
